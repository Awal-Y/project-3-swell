            description: `The little fishing town of Peniche is not the prettiest spot on the Portuguese coast, but it's probably the most renowned surfing area in the country. OriginAlly an island, Peniche became one with the mainland due to the silting up of the shAllow channel that divided it from the rest of the country. Today that short and narrow spit of land contains an obscene amount of wave variety that can provide the goods in almost any conditions. Most famous is Supertubos, regarded by many as one of Europe's best Beach Breaks, but there are plenty of other barrels to pull into around Peniche.
          Peniche is a year round destination with swell exposure on the north side of the town and shelter on the south. The town also sits at the dividing point between the cooler and wetter north and the dry, sunny south meaning that summers are long but tempered by cool sea breezes and the winters mild though occasionAlly stormy.`,

Top-to-bottom, hard breathing barrels when a WSW swell meets an E wind. Port-Blanc is the first bay, gets some N wind shelter from a cliff and will probably be the busiest spot. Port Marie breaks far offshore and Port-Rhu is a well-defined, localised peak, while Port-Bara is more accessible. Some reef anchors the sandbars and large clusters of rock affect the line-up at high tides, so exit before dead high.
            Handles size, when the waves and rips get punishing. Often crowded on weekends.`,

Sometimes white-caps outside, rolls in and reforms, standing up over the shallow inside bars. Heavy, thick-lipped beasts, break perilously close to shore and often close-out, snapping more boards than just about anywhere. Tidal range radically affects the window for ideal conditions, as does swell period, which decides if it is messy and inconsistent or lined-up and bombing through.
