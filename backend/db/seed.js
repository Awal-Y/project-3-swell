    description: 'A medium to large, long period NW swell is what’s needed to light-up this world-class right, first surfed by Aussies in the 1960’s. From the steep take-off at the outside peak, a seemingly endless succession of speed walls and cutback hooks present themselves. Occasional emerald green rooms appear on the sandy sections down the point. It’s easier to come in at one of the coves and walk back to jump off at the end between sets. Works on all but high tides, unless it’s huge, which is when it may be possible to ride back to Tarhazoute.',

Vertical lips and speed walls are held up by funnelling trade winds, bouncing off the hills. Experts only as it’s tricky getting in and out because of the urchins and sharp rock shelf. Try the keyhole from behind the large rock to the N. Always bigger than Tarhazoute so it’s often crowded.',

    description: '‘Killers’ is the most consistent Tarhazoute pointbreak, sucking up all available N-W swells. It’s always bigger than it looks and the paddle-out takes close to 15mins at high tide. In small swells, at low tide, the peak in front of the cliff has a short left (heading straight into some rocky caves) and a sectioning right. As the swell increases, the take-off area moves south and powerful, vertical walls, rumble down the point. Occasional barrels and difficult to make sections. The inside fires at high tide as it’s fully protected from N winds. Handles a lot of size.',
