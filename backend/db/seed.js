    description: 'A medium to large, long period NW swell is what’s needed to light-up this world-class right, first surfed by Aussies in the 1960’s. From the steep take-off at the outside peak, a seemingly endless succession of speed walls and cutback hooks present themselves. Occasional emerald green rooms appear on the sandy sections down the point. It’s easier to come in at one of the coves and walk back to jump off at the end between sets. Works on all but high tides, unless it’s huge, which is when it may be possible to ride back to Tarhazoute.',

    description: 'Sand bottom beach break with peaky left and rights. Great for improver/beginners, closes out on big swells. To the left, around the headland, is Banana Point and for the experienced surfer a gem lies between the two spots. Can be crowded on the weekends with locals. Relaxed vibe and great cafe on the beach.',

    description: 'Just south of the lighthouse of Cap Rhir, a washed-up ship boiler gives its name to this consistent and powerful righthander. Vertical lips and speed walls are held up by funnelling trade winds, bouncing off the hills. Experts only as it’s tricky getting in and out because of the urchins and sharp rock shelf. Try the keyhole from behind the large rock to the N. Always bigger than Tarhazoute so it’s often crowded.'

    description: 'Last stop before Tarhazoute, Immesouane remained authentic until the modern fishing port was built. Fortunately the long, mellow rights keep wrapping into the well-protected south-facing bay, while several well-defined peaks grace the cathedral side. Highly consistent and sometimes crowded.'

    description: '‘Killers’ is the most consistent Tarhazoute pointbreak, sucking up all available N-W swells. It’s always bigger than it looks and the paddle-out takes close to 15mins at high tide. In small swells, at low tide, the peak in front of the cliff has a short left (heading straight into some rocky caves) and a sectioning right. As the swell increases, the take-off area moves south and powerful, vertical walls, rumble down the point. Occasional barrels and difficult to make sections. The inside fires at high tide as it’s fully protected from N winds. Handles a lot of size.',

Unfortunately, it is very fickle, only breaking in big swells at low tide. There are more rights in the area under similar conditions.',
