Occasional emerald green rooms appear on the sandy sections down the point. It’s easier to come in at one of the coves and walk back to jump off at the end between sets.

    Peniche is a year round destination with swell exposure on the north side of the town and shelter on the south.

    description: `Heading east from Cape Town, Stilbaai is one of several excellent surf spots along the Garden Route, with other constant producers including Mossel Bay, Plettenburg Bay, and Wilderness. Stilbaai has a pretty constant shore Break in front of the village, but those in the know wait for a big south to southeast swell, when the right-hand point Break reAlly grinds. If you're lucky, you'll be joined on backline by the bay's semi-resident dolphins.`,

If you're planning on hanging around for a while, try to get a booking at Lands End guesthouse, which touts itself as "the closest accommodation to the sea in Africa", making it ideal for surfers. `,

At any other time, the Cape is a much better destination with a variety of point and shore Breaks, the best of which is Seal Point near the lighthouse.`,

It needs a medium, southerly swell to get it going, but when it does, it's a classic right-hand point-Break that rivals several of its more famous counterparts down south. It can get busy on weekends, but for most of the year, it's a relatively off-the-beaten track option for those that don't like to compete too much for space. `,
